\section*{Practical 5: Computing the R Ratio, III - MadGraph Comparison }


Why is it that we need both the theta cut and the gluon cut?
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{E_qE_{\bar{q}}(1-\cos\theta_{q\bar{q}})}
\end{equation}
Even at large momentum, we still have the collinear divergence, not just the soft divergence and vice versa.

We would like to compare our previous results to MadGraph. Let's open it up and compute the process
\begin{codeenv}
    generate e+ e- > d d~ g / z
display diagrams
\end{codeenv}
This is now in memory. We will output
\begin{codeenv}
    output CHEP_xcheck
\end{codeenv}
We now \codeinline{launch}
1 param
Note that all our parameters are in Python model. For example
\begin{codeenv}
   print(model.aS)
\end{codeenv}
etc. Can make sure same in 
2 run card. 
 True = fixed_ren_scale  ! if .true. use fixed ren scale
     True = fixed_fac_scale  ! if .true. use fixed fac scale

standard cuts, note transverse momentum is not beam axis momentum. Can fix these in ptj. This guarentees not soft, but may not fix collinear.

etaj    ! max rap for the jets. 
\begin{equation}
    \arctan \theta
\end{equation}
The pt cut basically does our rapditiyy, no other useful info for our process - our beam axis.
drjj 
delta r angular sep between two jets. This is what forces away from colinear. IN our python, we have a deltaR for two lorentz vecs.
instead of cos theta, compute rapidities, delta eta, then compute azimuthal angle delta phi. then delta R= \sqrt{\Delta \eta^2+\Delta\phi^2}

much easier than computing costheta experimentally - boosts etc.
0.4 is approx 10 deg of cos theta sep. if we remove this, then can see that we get a singular cross section. Indeed, the thing takes forever to run and each iteration is not within the prev. doesnt converge.

we also have tge mg unweighted events.

install MadAnalysis5

can now 3 to enable.
new option to specify the analysis to run

can add for exmale something like COSTHETA(g[1],d[1])) 50 -1 1 [ logY ]

can compare the histograms. can create same event fiel to use madanal on our event file when exporting our data.

lets add DELTa R in python passcuts to specifty cuts in  the same way as MG.
